### Description of issue
Our service utils are reading as html. Every resource we find says it's a typo in paths, but we can't find the typo and it's in all of our service utils.

### Steps attempted to resolve the issue
We have tried to change the quotes (single, double and back to single).

We have tried to redo fetch and have tried to redo a lot of functions to make the logic still make sense, but fix the error. Nothing has worked and we've stuck on this error since yesterday morning.
